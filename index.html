            <p> We are packed and ready, on our way to General Santos City International Airport (GES), I felt worried because on what might happen on the immigrations, and what might happen during our visit in Seminyak and Les. But apart from that, we were ecstatic and looking forward on the events that might happen during our stay in Bali. Upon arrival on General Santos City Airport, we took our last photo with our family for the month, and we head towards the gate where the guard checked our boarding pass and valid ID. After entering the gate, we proceeded to do the security checks, mainly by x-raying the bags. Once completed, we head towards the lounge and waited for our turn to board the plane.</p>
            <p> Once we have boarded the plane, we flew our way to Manila International Airport (MNL), also known as 'Ninoy Aquino International Airport' (NAIA), Terminal 2. The flight was so smooth, that we didn't knew that the plane already touched the ground upon landing. So after we landed on NAIA, we got security checked for our transfer on Terminal 1, via a mini-bus. </p>
            <p>After we arrived on Terminal 1, we had a lunch on Jollibee inside the terminal, and proceeded to the immigrations. Now this part is where I felt cold and nervous because I thought about what questions they may ask, and what should I answer. And lastly, is what if I was rejected in immigrations, because primarily I felt nervous. But, it turns out that I passed the immigrations, and I was very very relieved after that. </p>
